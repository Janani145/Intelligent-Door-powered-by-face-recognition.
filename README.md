# Intelligent-Door-powered-by-face-recognition.
This project is a smart door unlocking system that uses real-time face recognition. When a person approaches the door, the system activates the webcam to detect the face using Haar Cascade. It then compares the detected face with a reference image using SIFT feature matching. If the face is recognized, the system unlocks the door automatically and sends a welcome alert through SMS and email. If the face is not recognized, the system sends an alert message along with the captured image to notify the owner or security personnel. This system enhances security by providing automated access control and real-time notifications through multiple communication channels.
